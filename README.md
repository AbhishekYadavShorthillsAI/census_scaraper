## Description

This project demonstrates web scraping using Selenium to extract data from the U.S. Census Bureau's QuickFacts website. The script navigates through specified county and state combinations to retrieve population data and other statistics.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries installed:

- `selenium`: A web automation framework used to control web browsers.
- `pandas`: A data manipulation library.
- `chromedriver`: WebDriver for Chrome browser.

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium pandas
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Download the appropriate version of the [Chrome WebDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and place it in the `drivers` folder.
3. Prepare your CSV file with county and state data. Name it `census_geo_sheet.csv` and place it in the project directory.
4. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the following command to execute the script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Make sure to replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

## Project Structure

- `script_name.py`: The main script containing the web scraping logic.
- `drivers/`: Directory containing the Chrome WebDriver.
- `census_geo_sheet.csv`: CSV file with county and state data.
- `census_results.json`: JSON file to store the extracted data (commented out by default).
